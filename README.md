# codefundoo-idea
A repository containing the idea of the codefundoo challenge
I live in a different location:
We intend to create an application that allows the people who are living in a location different than their constituency. So, they can give their credentials to login using their voter id (might include a few more verifications, like email linked to voter ID) and checking if the persons name is in the voter list. Thereby, allowing him/her to cast their vote remotely via an application.
